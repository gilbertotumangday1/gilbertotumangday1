## Hi there 👋
As you can see from my profile, my name is Gilberto and I am currently studying computer engineering at U of T! I recently completed my second year of study and plan to focus my experience on embedded systems/physical AI throughout the rest of my studies. I am currently working on learning the foundations that embedded systems and IoT operate upon, and beginning a minor in Artificial Intelligence. I am looking to get more experience working on projects and collaborating with other engineers who are fascinated by the possibilities of computer engineering!
