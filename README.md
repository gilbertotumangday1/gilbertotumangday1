## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As you can see from my profile, my name is Gilberto and I am currently studying computer engineering at U of T! I am in my second year of study and plan to focus my experience on AI/ML throughout the rest of my program. I am currently working on learning the foundations that modern machine learning software operates on, and I am looking to get more experience working on projects and collaborating with other engineers who are fascinated by the possibilities of ML for computer engineering!
