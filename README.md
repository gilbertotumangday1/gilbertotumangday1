## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As you can see from my profile, my name is Gilberto and I am currently studying computer engineering at U of T! I am in my second year of study and plan to focus my experience on embedded systems/project management throughout the rest of my program. I am currently working on learning the foundations that embedded systems and IoT operate upon, and I am looking to get more experience working on projects and collaborating with other engineers who are fascinated by the possibilities of computer engineering!
